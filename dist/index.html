      <h1>Add UTM Parameters to a URL</h1>
      <p>A simple tool to help you track URL clicks in Google Analytics and other
        tools. Do you need a UTM parameter refresher?

      <h2 id="how">How do UTM parameters work?</h2>

      <p>Consider this scenario: myproduct.com (the <em>client</em>) buys an ad
        package from citynews.com (the <em>publisher</em>). A link to myproduct.com
        will appear on the citynews.com website and in the citynews.com email
        newsletter.</p>

      <p>The next day, a reader on the citynews.com website clicks on the ad and goes
        to myproduct.com. Later that day, another reader opens the citynews.com email
        newsletter and clicks on the email ad and goes to myproduct.com.</p>

      <p>When the client goes into Google Analytics (or any other analytics tool),
        they will see that two people clicked on myproduct.com. But that's not very
        helpful! The client would like to know a lot more about where those ad clicks
        came from, so they can adjust their ad order with citynews.com next month. </p>

      <p>This is the problem that UTM parameters help solve. The client, perhaps with
        help from the publisher, adds additonal information to their URL in the form of
        UTM parameters.</p>

      <p>For ads that appear on the citynews.com website, the client uses the URL</p>

      <p class="indented">https://myproduct.com/?<span class="source">utm_source=citynews</span>&<span
          class="medium">utm_medium=website</span></p>

      <p>For ads that appear in the citynews.com email newsletter, the client uses
        the URL</p>

      <p class="indented">https://myproduct.com/?<span class="source">utm_source=citynews</span>&<span
          class="medium">utm_medium=email</span></p>

      <p>Now when the client goes into Google Analytics, they will be able to see the
        <span class="source">source</span> of the clicks and the <span
        class="medium">marketing medium</span> used to deliver the clicks. So much
        more helpful!</p>

      <p>But wait, there's more. The <code>utm_campaign</code> parameter may be used to
        indicate the marketing campaign or ad buy associated with the link, and the
        <code>utm_content</code> parameter may be used to indicate the link's location 
        on the webpage or email. The form above makes it easy to add all of these
        parameters.</p>

      <h2>Why are UTM parameters so... difficult?</h2>

      <p>Although there are some reliable guidelines for how to use UTM parameters,
        there are no "right" answers or hard-and-fast rules. Why? Because the "right"
        answers are determined by <strong>what the client wants or expects to see in
          Google Analytics</strong>. For example, should <code>utm_source</code> be set
        to</p>

      <ul>
        <li>citynews</li>
        <li>citynews.com</li>
        <li>City News</li>
        <li>...?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These questions need to be 1) answered by the client or 2) answered by the
        publisher and communicated to the client.</p>
